				<p>
					In it's current state the game contains basic gameplay elements which have been polished for a refined gameplay experience.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					There are <strong>5</strong> enemies currently in-game all of which have unique mechanics and statistics. This is possible due to a modular enemy system which automatically creates randomised statistics for the enemies.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					All enemies use a finite state-machine which allows for enemy behavour to be dependant on the player and allows the game to manage enemies with logic.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					All in-game assets are created by me. Any characters that look alike are entirely coincidental and not intended.
